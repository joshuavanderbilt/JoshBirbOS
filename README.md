# JoshBirbOS
Alternative installation and live media for Debian with a nice default UI.

This is a Debian system with XFCE configured to look nice out of the box. It also contains useful programs that I use often.

Instructions to build: You will need a Debian GNU/Linux system, I recommend 12, the latest stable release at the time of writing. Install live-build and build-essential with apt. (sudo apt install live-build build-essential)
Clone the repository or download a release.
Run make in the repo directory.
